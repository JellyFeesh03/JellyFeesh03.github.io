<p><em><strong>Reminder:They re the same person,but trauma give him an identity crisis</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>#SIMPle History</strong></em><br>
Scaramouche, also known as Kunikuzushi (Japanese: ÂõΩÂ¥©) and by his codename The Balladeer, was the Sixth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.<br>
Scaramouche is a puppet created by Raiden Ei who appears as a minor antagonist throughout the game, becoming a major antagonist in Sumeru as Shouki no Kami. Following his defeat and learning the truth of the Tatarasuna Incident, he erases his existence from the Irminsul and becomes the Wanderer.<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745551889199.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
Scaramouche first appears as &quot;???&quot;<em><strong>(the hottest emo i ve seen in my entire life)</strong></em> during the Unreconciled Stars Event Quest The Crisis Deepens, where he introduced himself as a &quot;vagrant from Inazuma.&quot; While he appeared to be friendly at first, he learns of the Traveler's identity as the Honorary Knight and tries to strike them down, only to be stopped by Mona, who realized his intentions and helped the Traveler escape just in time.<br>
<em><strong>(he can ruin my life and i d say thank you)</strong></em></p>
<p>It is later revealed that he traveled to Liyue to investigate mysterious meteorites and entered a dream where he realized that the stars and sky are a &quot;lie&quot; and that &quot;The Jester&quot; had intentionally sent him without forewarning what would happen. After leaving a promising threat against the Traveler, he took his leave to confront the senior Harbinger.</p>
<p><img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745549645447.webp" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
He later headed to Inazuma to oversee the creation of Delusions at a secret facility and confronted the Traveler, recognizing them from before. Rather than facing them head on, he incited them into succumbing to the old gods' wrath<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745551117274.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em><strong>(what if i want to embrace you instead? heheheheh)</strong></em><br>
, but the plan was partially foiled when Yae Miko walked in. She then negotiated for the Traveler's safety by offering Ei's Gnosis, which he accepted and allowed them to leave safely.<em><strong>(`no gnosis no life‚Äô-ahh scaramouche)</strong></em> .</p>
<p>After obtaining the Gnosis and Signora's death, Scaramouche cut off contact with the Fatui, causing them to believe he had gone rogue. Childe went to Inazuma to track him down to no avail.When the Harbingers convened at Signora's funeral, Il Capitano asked Il Dottore about him, in which Dottore anticipated that Scaramouche would make his move soon.</p>
<p>With Dottore's assistance, the sages of Sumeru Akademiya worked to ascend Scaramouche into a new God of Wisdom under the name of &quot;Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal,&quot; comparable to Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. He also gained a follower in the form of Haypasia <em><strong>(fuck this bish,im his first follower,not you)</strong></em><br>
who had managed to see his past during her connection to Irminsul.<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745552281990.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">Showcasing his new power to the Traveler after learning Dottore was after her, he hurls lightning across Pardis Dhyai, striking Tighnari as collateral damage in the process.<em><strong>(Dont worry,green fox boy was fine,anyway so my man..-)</strong></em> .</p>
<p>The Traveler eventually returned with Nahida, the vessel of Lesser Lord Kusanali, and managed to defeat him after a prolonged fight, during which Nahida removed the Electro Gnosis powering his new form <em><strong>(Shouki no Kami-lovable gundam)</strong></em><br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745549861039.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
, much to his horror. In his attempt to beg Nahida not to remove it, he accidentally broke out from the tubing connecting him to his mechanical suit, causing him to fall to the ground <em><strong>(the traveler didnt even catch my babyyy aghhh)</strong></em><br>
and into a coma.<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745682178981.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<hr>
<p>Nahida would put him into her custody afterwards, hiding him in a secret location.<em><strong>(my room)</strong></em><br>
Scaramouche would soon recover and, knowing that he had no allies to rely on as Dottore had left with the two Gnoses <em><strong>(Dont worry baby,you have meeeee!!!)</strong></em> , makes a deal with Nahida to search Irminsul on her behalf and also help the Traveler despite being on uneasy terms with them.</p>
<p>During the investigation, Nahida left behind the true events of the Tatarasuna incident for him to discover.<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745552108614.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">Scaramouche was disgusted to learn that his second &quot;betrayal&quot; was masterminded by Dottore and decides to give his friends a second chance by erasing himself from Irminsul as the Kabukimono and his Fatui codename.<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745551544179.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><br>
This would retroactively cause his former seat to be remembered as being unoccupied for hundreds of years, but otherwise leave unchanged the tragedies that happened, as they still occurred with seemingly different actors and causes, as the altered memories and records convey<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745551364760.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"><em><strong>(basically he want to erase himself out of existence,but the motherfucking nature said no,making people just forgot him,but his actions that led to tragedy in the past remained the same)</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p>The Traveler would eventually discover Scaramouche's new incarnation as a wanderer,<br>
<img src="https://JellyFeesh03.github.io/post-images/1745551260196.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy">having somehow made his way to Sumeru in spite of having no recollection of his actual past. The Wanderer agrees to inherit Scaramouche's memories despite the pain and anguish it would bring.</p>
<p>During the process, the Everlasting Lord of Wisdom emerged to attack, but he recovers and defends the Traveler, gaining an Anemo Vision <em><strong>(because he s An emo)</strong></em>  in the process. Forsaking his previous identities and the Fatui, he took on a new name <em><strong>(WE RE GIVEN THE HONOR TO NAME HIM BTW aghhhhh!!!)</strong></em> and promises to help the Traveler behind the scenes when needed while desiring revenge against Dottore<br>
